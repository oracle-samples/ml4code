# Machine Learning for Source Code Knowledge Base

With the advancement in Natural Language Processing and Large Multimodal Models in general, a new field adopting the findings to source code and software development has been emerging. This knowledge base collects related papers, models, products, blogs of individuals, events, courses, tutorials, videos and many other artifacts on a best effort basis.

The aim is to generate a better understanding for everyone on how organizations can improve their software development lifecycle.

`ai4code`, `ml4code`, `dl4code`, `bigcode`, `deepcode`
